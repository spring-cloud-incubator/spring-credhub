= Spring CredHub Demo

This application can be used to test CredHub connectivity by deploying it to a Cloud Foundry platform that has CredHub installed. The demo application includes a deployment manifest that makes it simple to deploy the application. Use the https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/getting-started.html[`cf` CLI] to target and authenticate to a Cloud Foundry platform, and run the following commands:

----
$ ../gradlew assemble
$ cf push -f manifest.yml
----

After deploying the application, send an HTTP request to the demo application with this command:

----
$ curl -X POST https://spring-credhub-demo.cf.example.com/test -d @demo.json -H "Content-type: application/json"
----

The application will write, retrieve, and delete a set of JSON credentials in CredHub and show the results of each request.
